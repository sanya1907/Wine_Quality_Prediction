# Wine_Quality_Prediction

The above two codes has been done to show difference between the performance of DecisionTreeRegressor and RandomForestRegressor.
The result was that DecisionTreeRegressor is more efficient in giving the optimised result. The R^2 value of Decision_tree_regressor was founf to be 1.0 that proves the perfect fit
